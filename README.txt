Run 'Preliminary.R' first, only need to run once

Algorithms contained in the following:
'LDA Package Clean.R' - LDA Algorithm; Can run either linear or proportional and either 11,340 observations or the entire data set in the test case
'KNN Package Clean.R' - Nearest Neighbor Algorithm; Can run either linear or proportional and either 11,340 observations or the entire data set in the test case
'Multiclass Package Clean.R' - Runs Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithm simultaneously; Can run either linear or proportional and either 11,340 observations or the entire data set in the test case
'Classification Tree.R' - Classification Tree Algorithm; Can run either linear or proportional and either 5,670 observations or the entire data set in the test case
'Random Forest.R' - Random Forest Algorithm; Can run either linear or proportional and either 5,670 observations or the entire data set in the test case
'Graphs.R' - Creates figures from slides 6, 8, 22

Recommended to remove all variables except for data in between running each algorithm
